An open-source C++ library to visualize p-hierarchical basis finite element (p-FEM) solutions on the scientific visualization application ParaView.

  Author: Janitha Gunatilake, developed in 2023.

ParaView:

As p-FEM solutions does not directly match the input file format of VTK files, this library brideges that gap.
Here, the input: hierarchical vtk file and the output is a .vtk file that can be read in ParaView.
